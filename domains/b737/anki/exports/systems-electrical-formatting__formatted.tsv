sys-elec-psc-010	Which buses does each AC power system consists of?	"• Transfer bus (1)
• Main bus (1)
• Galley buses (2)
• Ground Service Bus (1)."	common format_bullets systems
sys-elec-psc-020	What does selecting GRD PWR Switch ON do on the ground with both generators off the bus?	"• If ground power available: removes previously connected power from AC transfer buses
• connects ground power to AC transfer buses if power quality is correct"	common format_bullets llights-switches systems
sys-elec-psc-021	What does selecting either APU GEN switch to ON do to the AC transfer buses?	"• If neither AC transfer bus powered by IDG: - Connects both AC transfer buses to APU generator
• disconnected external power, illuminates opposite SOURCE OFF light until other APU GEN switch moved to ON. If both AC transfer buses powered by IDGs: - Powers the related transfer bus from the APU generator
• - Other transfer bus continues to receive power from the IDG"	common format_bullets lights-switches systems
sys-elec-fail-033	If the airplane takes off with the APU powering both transfer buses and the APU is shut down or fails, what happens? How many times can this occur?	- Engine generators are automatically connected to their related AC transfer buses. - This occurs only once in flight and only in that circumstance.	common format_bullets systems verbatim
sys-elec-swt-040	BUS TRANSFER switch — AUTO (guarded): what does it allow for AC and DC?	AC: BTBs operate automatically to maintain power to AC transfer buses from any operating generator or external power. DC: DC cross tie relay automatically provides normal or isolated operation as required.	common format_bullets llights-switches systems verbatim
sys-elec-swt-041	BUS TRANSFER switch — OFF: what does it do (AC + DC + TR3 input)?	AC: isolates AC transfer bus 1 from AC transfer bus 2 (if one IDG is supplying both). DC: DC cross tie relay opens to isolate DC bus 1 from DC bus 2. Also inhibits TR3 input from connecting to AC transfer bus 1.	common format_bullets llights-switches systems verbatim
sys-elec-fail-050	What is the order of load shedding during single generator operation?	"• Sheds incrementally: (1) galleys and main bus on transfer bus 2
• (2) galleys and main bus on transfer bus 1
• (3) IFE buses."	common format_bullets systems verbatim
sys-elec-fail-051	When source capacity returns to two-generator operation, what restores automatically and what requires CAB/UTIL reset?	IFE/PASS buses restore automatically. Galley and main bus power require CAB/UTIL switch reset (OFF then ON) to restore.	common format_bullets llights-switches systems verbatim
sys-elec-psc-001	What are the two basic principles of operation for the B737 electrical system?	No paralleling of AC sources. Connecting a source to a transfer bus automatically disconnects an existing source.	common format_bullets systems verbatim
sys-elec-psc-002	What are the three main divisions of the B737 electrical power system?	"• AC power system
• DC power system
• standby power system."	common format_bullets systems
sys-elec-fail-052	APU-only electrical power in flight: what is shed automatically (and what else if overload persists)?	All galley buses and main buses are automatically shed. If load still exceeds limits, both IFE buses are also automatically shed.	common format_bullets systems verbatim
sys-elec-fail-053	APU on the ground with overload sensed: what does the APU shed, and how can you attempt restoration?	Sheds galley buses and main buses until load is within limits. Restoration can be attempted by moving CAB/UTIL switch OFF then back ON.	common format_bullets llights-switches systems verbatim
sys-elec-fail-067	Under which two conditions does the cross bus tie relay open?	"• At glideslope capture during a flight director or autopilot ILS approach
• and when the BUS TRANSFER switch is positioned to OFF."	common format_bullets systems verbatim
sys-elec-ind-068	TR UNIT light: when does it illuminate in flight vs on the ground?	In flight: illuminates if: [TR1 OR  (TR2 AND TR3)]  has failed. On the ground: any TR fault causes the light to illuminate.	common format_bullets llights-switches systems verbatim
sys-elec-ind-070	ELEC light: what does it indicate on the ground and in-flight?	On the ground: indicates a fault exists in the DC power system or standby power system. In flight: ELEC light is inhibited.	common format_bullets llights-switches systems verbatim
sys-elec-psc-065	Under normal conditions, how are DC bus 1, DC bus 2, and the DC standby buses powered? How are they connected to one another?	• .TR1 and TR2 each power DC bus 1, DC bus 2, and the DC standby bus. They are connected via the cross bus tie relay	common format_bullets systems
sys-elec-psc-080	What is the chemistry and nominal voltage of the battery? Where is it located?	"• 24V nickel-cadmium battery
• located in the electronics compartment."	common format_bullets systems verbatim
sys-elec-fail-083	After loss of both generators, which DC buses does the battery power?	"• Battery bus
• DC standby bus
• Hot battery bus
• Switched hot battery bus."	common format_bullets systems verbatim
sys-elec-psc-091	What are the components (2) and buses (5) that comprise the Standby Power System	"• Static inverter
• main battery.
• AC standby bus
• DC standby bus
• battery bus
• hot battery bus
• switched hot battery bus."	common format_bullets systems
sys-elec-psc-092	With both AC Transfer Buses powered by their generators and the guards down on the BAT and STANDBY POWER switches, what powers the following buses: AC Standby Bus; DC Standby Bus; Battery Bus; Hot Battery Bus; Switched Hot Battery Bus? 	"• In the Normal Standby Power System Configuration, what powers the following buses?  AC Standby Bus: AC Transfer Bus #1
• DC Standby Bus: TR1, TR2, and TR3
• Battery Bus: TR3
• Hot Battery Bus: Battery and/or Battery Charger
• Switched Hot Battery Bus: Battery and/or Battery Charger."	common special-formatting systems
sys-elec-fail-093	With the loss of all AC generators and the guards down on the BATTERY  and STANDBY POWER switches, what powers the following buses: AC Standby Bus; DC Standby Bus; Battery Bus; Hot Battery Bus; Switched Hot Battery Bus? 	"• With the loss of all AC generators and the guards down on the BATTERY  and STANDBY POWER switches, what powers the following buses: AC Standby Bus: Battery via static inverter
• DC Standby Bus: battery
• Battery Bus: battery
• Hot Battery Bus: battery
• Switched Hot Battery Bus: battery?"	common special-formatting systems
